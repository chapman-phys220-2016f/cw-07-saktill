# PHYS220 CW 7

**Author(s):** _\<Will and Sakthi\>_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-07-saktill.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-07-saktill)

**Due date:** 2016/10/18

## Specification

**Reminder: We have switched to Python3 officially.**

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. p.683, C.1, in ```nonhomogeneous_linear_ODE.py```
1. p.683, C.2, in ```nonlinear_ODE.py```

To cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```cw7-odes.ipynb``` that imports each file and carefully discusses your answers to each question. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section. 

Pro-tip: using git to manage conflicts on Jupyter notebooks is a pain. I recommend delegating one person from your group to edit the notebook, to avoid merge conflicts.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

This assignment seemed like mainly more of the same, in terms of making us do seemingly simple things, but on the computer instead of on paper. However it's also cool to be able to plot a solution to something using numerical approximation without actually solving your equation. That's exciting news for when/if we get to a solution at some point that doesn't have a closed form solution.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
